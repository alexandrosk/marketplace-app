### All contributions are welcome! 🙏
Refactor as much as you want, add new features, fix bugs, etc.
Since this was done as a demo and PoC for most of the time I didn't focus on the code quality and structure.

## Description 📝 
This is a shopify app that allows you to create a multivendor marketplace.
It uses metaobjects to create a vendor object that is connected to a collection.

The idea is that by using this app we will be able to create a multivendor marketplace that is fully customizable and scalable easily with shopify.


## Setup 🛠
This app uses shopify's [remix app template](https://github.com/Shopify/shopify-app-template-remix) as a base. 
Also, it uses shopify [react vite](https://github.com/montalvomiguelo/theme-extension-vite) as a base for the frontend, theme app extension.

1. `pnpm i`
2. `pnpm run dev`
3. `cd extensions/account-page && pnpm i && pnpm run dev`
4. Important for theme app extension: change the proxy url in the shopify app settings to your updated cloudflare url
